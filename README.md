# Library_management_system
Wrote this project to understand the git rep: - the ins and out of it. 
***********************************************************************
One simple project idea to practice OOP in Python is to create a program that simulates a library management system. Here's an example of how you can structure your classes:

1. Library Class - this class would represent the library itself, and would have attributes such as name, location, and a list of books available.
2. Book Class - this class would represent a book in the library, and would have attributes such as title, author, ISBN, and number of copies available.
3. Member Class - this class would represent a library member, and would have attributes such as name, address, email, and membership ID.
5. Loan Class - this class would represent a loan transaction between a member and a book, and would have attributes such as the member ID, book ID, loan date, and return date.
